Colloidal System Free Energy and Phase Diagram Calculation

This project contains Python scripts for calculating the free energy and phase diagrams of colloidal systems using different potentials, including the inverse power potential and Yukawa potential. 

Files Overview

unversegl.py: Calculates compressibility factor, free energy, pressure, and chemical potential for a colloidal system under inverse power potential, using Carnahan-Starling equation for fluid and solid phases.

ykgl.py: Simulates Yukawa potential interactions in colloidal systems, calculating free energy and equations of state, focusing on screening effects and phase stability.

ykiplg.py: Combines both Yukawa and inverse power potentials to simulate and visualize fluid-gas phase transitions.

How to Run

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed: numpy, matplotlib, and scipy.

Run each script individually in a Python environment to observe calculations and phase diagrams.

unversegl.py and ykgl.py generate graphs and console outputs summarizing the physical properties.
